# 📝 Python To-Do Web App (No Framework)

This is a minimal web-based To-Do application built from scratch using only Python’s standard library (`http.server`). It demonstrates how to handle HTTP requests, serve HTML and static files, and manage simple data storage — all without any external frameworks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add tasks to your To-Do list  
- View all tasks (persisted in a text file)  
- Simple HTML interface  
- Serves static assets (CSS, images, etc.)  
- Custom 404 error page  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external packages needed!

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:


python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
⚡ Usage
Run the application:

python app.py
Make sure you’re in the project directory and app.py is the main file.

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080

📝 How It Works
Server:
Uses Python’s http.server to handle HTTP requests.

Routing:

/ – Home page (shows and adds tasks)

/add – Handles adding new tasks (POST)

/static/ – Serves static files (CSS, images, etc.)

Data Storage:
Tasks are saved line-by-line in data/tasks.txt.

Templating:
Simple HTML replacement for task list.

🛡️ Notes
The app creates a data/ directory and tasks.txt file automatically if they don’t exist.

Only basic error handling is provided.

For educational/demo purposes only — not for production use.

Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name before using this in your project.
